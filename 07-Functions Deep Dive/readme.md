 Go, * and & are used for working with pointers:

* (asterisk) is the dereference operator. It is used to access the value that a pointer points to. For example, if p is a pointer to an int (*int), then *p gives you the actual int value.

& (ampersand) is the address-of operator. It is used to get the memory address of a variable. For example, &x gives you a pointer to x.
